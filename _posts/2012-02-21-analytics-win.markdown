Inexplicably, for the longest time I was reticent to enable any sort of
analytics on my personal site. Partially because, to be honest, it's not
as if my blog is well read (or so I assume, but soon I'll have numbers
to back that claim up). As I try to get more involved in the world, I've
found my site is useful as a portfolio of sorts - not so much in the way
of "look at my sexy site" as "here's the cool things I do". I've noticed
that [GitHub](https://github.com) has had some DDoS issues lately, and as
I host this site on my [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/), I wanted
to minimise any potential downtimes. I'd also noticed that some of my
pages were a bit on the slow side to load, as [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
appears to load quite a bit of javascript. I admit to being a fan of many of
the asides, and to have written some of my own. 

In order to improve this situation, I took two steps:

0. I enabled Google Analytics: 
while I'm not a particular fan of feeding the privacy black hole with even more
data, it appears to be the only viable option at this time. I have been eyeing
[Mint](http://haveamint.com/), but I am abstaining from purchasing anything new
until I leave the Netherlands (in a little over a week) just to stay on the
safe side of my bank account. (30 USD may not sound like much, but that's about 
two days worth of döner or shawarma for dinner.) 
0. I set up the site on CloudFlare.

What I didn't realise is that several of my older posts actually rank high on
Google's search results; however, the link on Google points to the old url 
from when I was using [blazeblogger](http://blaze.blackened.cz). Because the 
content is actually useful documentation, I was able to set up redirects so 
that the page is back online and people can use the information now.
