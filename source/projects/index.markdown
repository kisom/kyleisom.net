## Hardware Projects
This page is all hardware hacking projects; software projects can be found
on [brokenlcd](http://www.brokenlcd.net).

Project updates are mostly likely to go [tumblr](http://brokenlcd.tumblr.com)
before propagating here. I don't have hacking space at the moment, so all
of the following projects are on hold. 


### Arduino Development Board

I put together a quick Arduino development board. This is mostly a project 
to develop a handheld computer, but it is also useful as a quick development 
platform to test interfacing with sensors and peripherals. It includes a 
thumbstick and 16x2 LCD to allow interfacing and quick menus to provide 
access to test functions. It made developing some Arduino libraries much 
faster than if I was using serial. I've got photos up at a 
[Picasa web album](http://picasaweb.google.com/brokenlcd/ArduinoHandheld).
My Arduino libraries are available on my 
[Arduino page](/arduino/index.html). 


### MP3 Development Board

This is a prebuilt board with an LPC2148, a VS1002 MP3 chip, a Nokia 132x132 
LCD screen, and some other nifty parts. This is kind of my starter project 
to work with writing code to interface with various bits of hardware. I've 
got a [software repo and wiki](http://github.com/kisom/sfe_mp3) on github.


### Planned Projects
* **an SD/MMC processor module using an ATmega324 to allow drop in access 
to a FAT32-based USB mass storage system**
* **an arduino-based geotagging camera with wireless enabled**
* **an arduino-based secure webserver**
* **a differential-drive mobile robot**
