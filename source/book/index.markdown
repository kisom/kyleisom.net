title: "Practical Data Security"
---

I started trying to write a book on practical data security for developers; 
it's kind of stalled but I'd like to publish chapters here.

### Introduction to Crypto
Before I got it in my head to write a book, I wrote a short article to
explain the basics of cryptography, illustrated with Python (and 
specifically, the [PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
library. I published the article 
[on my blog](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/06/17/intro-to-crypto/) and
I have a [PDF available](/downloads/crypto_intro.pdf).

### The book so far:
0. [Outline](/book/outline/)
0. [Acknowledgements](/book/acknowledgements/)
0. [Introduction](/book/introduction/)
0. [Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Security](/book/chapter1/)
0. [Chapter 2: Practical Introduction to Cryptography](/book/chapter2/)
0. [Chapter 3: Trust, Usability, and the Social Security Problem](/book/chapter3)
0. [Chapter 4: Practical Threat Modeling](/book/chapter4/)
0. [Bibliography](/book/bibliography/)

You should consider all of these chapters as drafts. Some are still in the 
process of being written. I've put them up for peer review, and because maybe
they can help you now.

I've been using [easybook](http://www.easybook-project.org) to build 'publishable'
versions of the work in progress.
