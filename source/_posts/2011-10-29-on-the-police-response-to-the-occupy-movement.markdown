(Originally written on 2011-10-29 and an unusual departure from the
usual technical content.)

TL;DR One more combat veteran is disgusted and appalled by the actions
of a few police officers during the course of the Occupy movement.

I just got done watching [this
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmEHcOc0Sys), and the outrage I
feel towards those peace officers who disrespect the freedoms that I,
and many better man than I, have ostensibly fought to protect, welled
up in my chest like a Midwest thunderstorm. While we were told that
our actions in Iraq were in the name of freedom, while many people back
home who supported us with letters and care packages were told we were
defending freedom, the basic rights of **American citizens** are being
trampled on by a few officers and police departments.

Right up front: I don't have anything against police officers. Yes, they
do unpopular things. I understand that. When I came home, there were times
when anti-war protesters took their protests to a personal level. As a 19
or 20 year old to return home from war, having seen friends and brothers
killed, having experienced the trauma of being having your vehicle hit
by an IED, and having had to make decision whether to take another man's
life or not (despite not being considered old enough to be responsible
enough to consume alcohol), to have people tell you that you are a baby
killer is a fairly difficult and emotionally trying experience. I took
several of my best years out of my life to serve my country and gave
up quite a number of opportunities in order to do so. I understand
many of the feelings that I am sure many police officers feel when
ordinary citizens harass and rail on them for actions they take that are
unpopular. I get it. I know that as despicable as resorting to violence
is, the fact of the matter is that humanity forces the need. Would that
we were all enlightened, instead of being little more than clever apes
with Facebook, but I understand that is not the case. Trust me.

But as a fighting man in an actual war zone - and despite the so-called
"threat of terror" that supposedly "looms" here, America is not a
war zone - had I fired even non-lethal rounds at unarmed civilians
unprovoked because I felt scared due to the loud noises they were making,
I would have faced military punishments. Many soldiers were punished
for less. As a professional soldier, I am trained and expected to make
reliable snap shoot/no-shoot judgements. During the surge in Iraq, when
I was in a very kinetic (military word for an area of active fighting)
environment, we still were held accountable for our actions. If use of
force was justified (and it was on many occasions), there is no issue.

So to see American police officers engaging American citizens who are
not wielding weapons is aggravating in no small way. As I mentioned in
the opening paragraph, rage is a much better term for the emotion. It
isn't all the police officers, but just as a few soldiers cast shame
over the entire US military, a few idiot police officers are casting
shame over their departments and the governments they represent. If
those officers were in my platoon, in addition to military judgement
they would be taken out back and beaten.

I don't want to rant, I don't want to say anything stupid, and I don't
want to end up resorting to ad-hominem attacks. Suffice it to say that
many of us in the military, regardless of our agreement (or lack thereof)
with the protesters' cause, stood up and defended the right of those
protesters to have their voice heard. It is a sad day when the populace
needs protection from the very police officers whose job is allegedly to
protect that self-same populace. Let us not forget who pays the salary
of those police officers.

For those police officers who maintain their calm and professional
bearing, I applaud you. I understand the desire to smash stupid people
in the face for saying and thinking stupid things. Unfortunately, as a
police officer, you are bound to protect those people. I have been in
similar situations in the military, and I understand the frustration. If
you feel so strongly about it, do it the old-fashioned way - go on your
own, out of uniform, and throw down. If it's a departmental policy to
carry out those types of actions, then the government no longer serves
its people and no longer upholds the Constitution, and it's time for
you to be replaced.
