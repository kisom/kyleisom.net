!["You've got Leanpub royalties! image"](/img/yglpbr.png)

I got my first royalty cheque today. It may not seem like a big deal (and would
seem like even less of a big deal if you saw the amount), but it represents a
first for me: getting paid to do something I wanted to do.

This book is actually the second one I tried to write (third, actually, if you
count the version I started in C before switching to Go), and to be honest,
when I started I wasn't sure I was going to finish it. I still have a ways to
go before I finish this one, but the end is in sight. Having completed 7.5
chapters out of the projected 14, it means I'm over halfway done; as of this
morning, the published version of the book stands at 97 pages and 20,372 words.
That's more than I ever thought I would get to.

Part of the reason that I think I've made it this far is that Leanpub really
makes it easy for me to publish the book as I write it. One of the struggles
I had with the original two projects was the book format. I never found a good
workflow for a book I was working on in my spare time; particularly, generating
anything other than PDFs was very difficult. Having it in several formats makes
it easier for people to read it; getting feedback from people has been
instrumental in keeping up my motivation to finish it. I think that sometimes,
the thought that I'm wasting my time on something with zero impact holds me
back. The response for the book, especially for such a niche book, has been
warm. As a writer, it helps to know people find it useful.

I'm looking forward to seeing this book through. Look at me blogging when
there's a chapter on authentication with public key cryptography to write!
