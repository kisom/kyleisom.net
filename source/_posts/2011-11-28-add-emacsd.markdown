In the spirit of many of my online profiles which proudly declare "my
commit log is my blog," I've decided to start using that in my posts.
Here is the first such attempt.

     commit 40bbc533313a43192506b682fe546304d8603d11

        add .emacs.d/init.el


I've started using emacs, which is an act of such great blasphemy for
a red-blooded stalwart vim-wielding hacker such as myself that I find
it difficult to come to grips with sometimes. But there is a method to
my madness, and it isn't just that my morals are so comprised right
now in this nadir of my life that I've even started learning
javascript (a running joke). 

Due to my current work situation, and the prospect of traveling to and
spending several months in a region with little to no network
connectivity, I've purchased a new 11" Macbook Air. I chose the 11"
model solely for price reasons; I would much prefer a larger
laptop. I've previously owned two EeePCs (the 7"
[Eee PC 701](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC#Eee_700_series)
and the 11"
[Eee PC 1101HAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC#Specifications)),
so I'm familiar with the smaller form-factor, and not a huge fan to be
honest. 

Enter emacs - I can do all my work on emacs, with an integrated python
development environment incorporating a shell, pdb (with a pane that
shows the current line of the file being executed as you're stepping
through code). I'll still have the OS X desktop,
[iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com/),
[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/), and
[macvim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/). But for getting things
done, I think that emacs is going to help out a lot.

Plus it's backed by a Lisp flavour.
